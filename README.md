# Natural-Language-Processing-Machine Learning Course Video Search Dashboard

## Project Overview

In this project, I have integrated various tools and techniques learned throughout the course to create a final project. The objective is to develop an application that enables students to quickly locate and view video content by searching for topics and key phrases.

## Business Scenario

The course includes more than 40 videos covering a broad range of ML topics. Your task is to create an application that allows students to efficiently search for and view video content by specific topics and key phrases. All videos have been downloaded to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. 

The assignment given was to produce a dashboard that meets my supervisorâ€™s requirements.

## Project Steps

To complete this project, these were the steps followed:

1. **Viewing the Video Files**
   - Access and organize the video files stored in the Amazon S3 bucket.

2. **Transcribing the Videos**
   - Transcribe the audio content of the videos into text format.

3. **Normalizing the Text**
   - Clean and normalize the transcribed text for consistency and accuracy.

4. **Extracting Key Phrases and Topics**
   - Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract key phrases and topics from the normalized text.

5. **Creating the Dashboard**
   - Develop a user-friendly dashboard that allows students to search for and view video content based on the extracted key phrases and topics.

This README file outlines the steps and processes involved in developing the ML course video search dashboard. By following these steps, I have created an application that enhances the learning experience for students by providing easy access to specific video content.
